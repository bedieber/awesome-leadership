# Aschenbrenner, Peter. *The Boss - Von Bruce Springsteen Fürhungsstärke lernen.* Wiley (2020).

This book connects leadership lessons with stories from Bruce Springsteens Life and way to success.

As a leadership book it covers all important areas from mindset, personal capacities, character up to specialized know-how and also gives insights into many stories from the author's work as consultant. As such it is very worth reading especially if you are just starting in a leadership role or if you haven't updated your leadership philosophy in the past ten years.

The connections to Springsteen seem at some points rather far fetched and may result from the author's fascination with The Boss and may also serve marketing purposes. Still, the stories are very interesting if you are interested in Bruce Springsteen.
