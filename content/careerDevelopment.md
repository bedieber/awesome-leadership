# Supporting your team members in their career development

 > This section is the result of the corresponding "Leadership Monthly" workshop with contributions of Manuel Fasching, Cony Wiedenig, Peter Jelitsch, René Panzar, Claudia Streussnig and Horst Pichler.

An important part of a leadership role is to make sure your team members have the room to grow and develop. Coming up with an adequate vision and specific goals for someone is not always straightforward.
Jointly defining a career vision and defining personal development goals can have a multitude of effects. First and most importantly, it opens up opportunities for your team member to reflect and think of a development perspective. Especially younger colleagues might not be used to this way of thinking. Second, it is a motivating experience if done right. Third, in a larger team context, this process can help to develop a healthier knowledge and skill landscape. 

## Before you start
Before you can go into a development process, it is important to know where you are starting from. As a lead, make sure to establish a common base for both of you. This can be achieved using various feedback techniques. As an example, your team member could make use of a [360° feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback). When you give direct feedback, use a feedback method like [Situation-Behaviour-Impact](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm) or [Non-violent communication](https://positivepsychology.com/non-violent-communication/).

Take enough time for the process, any rush will harm your colleague. Be well prepared for your feedback and career development talks with a specific agenda and documented results. Keep in mind, that some team members need a little push or want to be actively approached and encouraged to start the process of self development (don't be too pushy though).

## Defining visions and goals
The specific definition of a career vision and goals may be a longer process that needs multiple meetings and reflection time in between. At first, it might be enough to just trigger a thought and reflection process. Some people also need to step out of their comfort zone to properly develop. In any case, goals and vision should come from the employee, not the lead. Some (especially in early career stages) may need some support in finding proper vision and goals and formulating them. 

Make use of tools in this process. The (GROW)[https://www.performanceconsultants.com/grow-model] (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) is a good model to coach someone through this process. If available, make use of an existing career model to show options and potential. Be honest in the Reality part and don't promise to coach someone into an unrealistic option (specifically: make clear that difficult development paths take more time). 

Once you have defined a vision, jointly break it down to ([SMART, PURE, CLEAR](../Readme.md#goals-smart-pure-clear)) goals that are specific for a certain timeframe (e.g., the next quarter). This could be the development or improvement of a certain skill. In this case, find suitable trainings or similar. You might also suggest other team members as sparring partners or mentors.

## Monitoring the progress and following up

In any case, make it clear, that you as lead will create the environment for reaching the goal but that actually driving the development is within the employee's responsibility. 

Accompany your colleague on the path with one-on-one talks to create regular check points where you talk about the progress. Also make sure to document the process and progress properly (and visible for both).

For goals that are shared with the team (someone might not be comfortable with sharing some specific personal goals), consider using visual management techniques to make it visible and present to everyone (this ensures that goals are not overlooked or forgotten).
