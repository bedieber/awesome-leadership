# Belbin team roles

Each team has its own dynamics that also change with every new member in the team. Everyone of us naturally takes a specific role in the team in terms of behavior and functions. Meredith Belbin has invested several decades into researching the optimal combination of characters to form a perfect, high-performing team.\
Currently, the Belbin team role model defines nine core roles that people take over (in three categories).
