# Introduction
Leadership is a crucial element in succesful organizations.
I believe that a successful leader has both, knowledge and tools (along with some other critical factors). In this list, I want to provide links to literature, resources and methods that can be useful when leading others. The focus will be on modern leadership styles as well as the area of modern work as common in software engineering.
I try  to curate this as a classic awesome list. However, at some points I will contribute more background and literature review so that you find what you are looking for quicker.
