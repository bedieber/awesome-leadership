# Introduction
Leadership is a crucial element in succesful organizations.
I believe that a successful leader has both, knowledge and tools (along with some other critical factors). In this list, I want to provide links to literature, resources and methods that can be useful when leading others. The focus will be on modern leadership styles as well as the area of modern work as common in software engineering.
I try  to curate this as a classic awesome list. However, at some points I will contribute more background and literature review so that you find what you are looking for quicker.


# Methods and tools

Having the proper tools at hand is a crucial part of leading people. By tools, I generally mean methods you can use in moderating, meetings, 1:1s and others that help you gain information, identify necessary actions, prioritize and track tasks. This is important especially in less hierarchical environments where you want your team to equally contribute to mutual success.

Just let me hint you to the most important method you have at your disposal (in my opinion): **Retrospectives** \
Retros, if done right, give you essential insights into what works and what doesn't in your team and help you to identify ways to improve. So I strongly recommend, you dive deep into how to do retros properly and effectively and what tools you can use. Nearly all of the tools I list here are valuable in retrospectives. 

I am categorizing here according to "The decision book" (see below) as this is a neat categorization to me. However, some methods don't only fit in one category (e.g., you can use a SWOT analysis in multiple settings).

## Improving myself

Methods in this category are useful to identify goals and challenges, structure ideas and information in oneselves daily work.

### The Eisenhower matrix
The classic

### SWOT analysis

### Goals: SMART, PURE, CLEAR

## Understanding myself


## Understanding others
Methods in here are used to gather insights to a team or group of people and their interworking. This includes finding friction or pain points, 

### The team canvas

### Sailboat / Speedboat and friends
This one has many other names. Essentially, this method is used to **identify aspects** of your (team) work, **that help or** others that **hinder you or your team**.

### Belbin team roles

## Improving others

## Tool resources

## Books on leadership tools
The books listed here give you handy tools for your day-to-day leadership work. Mainly, those are tools for moderating (e.g., a retrospective or meeting) as well as decision facilitations for you and your team. I try to collect many of the tools also in the Methods and tools sections above individually. However, reading the books in addition is a good idea. 

### Krogerus & Tschäpeller
These books (essentially the one book but in two editions and languages), contain a concise collection of very valuable tools. They are shortly explained, just enough for you to get a feeling how it works and look for more info in specialized literature (i.e., googling how to apply it :) ). Thus, I recommend this as a handy field guide for almost every situation.

The culture which we come from strongly influences how we act within a team. Especially if you are working with a cross-culture team, this book will give you very important tools to improve communication and generate value. 

### [Hohmann, Luke. *Innovation games: creating breakthrough products through collaborative play*. Pearson Education, 2006.](books/hohmann2006innovationgames.md)
This book will give you many valuable tools to improve your team and create value in group moderation, meetings and retrospectives.

### (German) [Steyrer, Johannes. *Die Macht der Manipulation - Wie man sich durchsetzt, wie man sich schützt*. Ecowin (2018).](books/steyrer2018manipulation.md)
**On the details page, I also list English literature from the book's references to give also non-German speakers an insight.** This book does not directly contain leadership tools. However, it shows some of the psychological tricks used in manipulation of people. If you are aware of those, you can prevent being manipulated and also protect your team from it. Still trying to find an adequate English book about then topic.

## Some worthwile perspectives for (not only) leaders in (not only) technology
Putting a critical view on the own doing is a core ability for evolving in any kind of position. Especially in technology, we tend to be easily distracted by the next shiny thing and often fail to reflect on potential downsides. Here is some literature that helps us expand our view and look beyond tech fanciness.

## Leadership by Simon Sinek 
### Leaders eat last
Simon Sinek's [video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReRcHdeUG9Y) of the "Leaders eat last" book mentioned above. Very detailed and watchworthy. 

Here is a [video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_osKgFwKoDQ) of the "Infinity game", a follow-up work of his.
